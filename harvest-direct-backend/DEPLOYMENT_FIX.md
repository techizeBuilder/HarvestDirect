# ðŸš¨ Backend Deployment Fix

## Issue Found:
```
Error: Cannot find module '/opt/render/project/src/dist/index.js'
```

## Root Cause:
Render is looking for the file in `/src/dist/` but your file is in the root as `index.js`

## Quick Fix Steps:

### 1. Update Render Build Settings:
- **Build Command**: `npm install`
- **Start Command**: `node index.js`
- **Root Directory**: `.` (current directory)

### 2. Alternative: Move index.js to expected location:
```bash
mkdir -p src/dist
cp index.js src/dist/index.js
```

### 3. Or update package.json main field:
Change from:
```json
"main": "index.js"
```
To:
```json
"main": "./index.js"
```

## Recommended Solution:
Update your Render service settings to use the correct start command: `node index.js`
